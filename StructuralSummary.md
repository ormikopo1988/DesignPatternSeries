# Structural Design Patterns Summary

# Composite: 
	- Represents object hierarchies where individual objects and compositions of objects are treated the same way.

# Adapter: 
	- Allows converting the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect.

# Decorator: 
	- Adds additional behavior to an object dynamically.

# Facade: 
	- Provides a simplified, higher-level interface to a subsystem. Clients can talk to the facade rather than individual classes in the subsystem.

# Flyweight: 
	- Allows sharing common state between multiple objects.

# Bridge: 
	- Allows representing hierarchies that grow in two different dimensions independently.

# Proxy: 
	- Allows providing a substitute for another object. The proxy object delegates all the work to the target object and contains some additional behavior.
