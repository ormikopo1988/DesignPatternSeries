# Behavioral Design Patterns Summary

# Memento: 
	- Allows restoring an object to a previous state.

# State: 
	- Allows an object to behave differently depending on the state it is in.

# Iterator: 
	- Allows iterating over an object without having to expose the object’s internal structure (which may change in the future).

# Strategy: 
	- Allows passing different algorithms (behaviours) to an object.

# Template Method: 
	- Allows defining a template (skeleton) for an operation. Specific steps will then be implemented in subclasses.

# Command: 
	- Allows decoupling a sender from a receiver. The sender will talk to the receiver through a command. Commands can be undone and persisted.

# Observer: 
	- Allows an object notify other objects when its state changes.

# Mediator: 
	- Allows an object to encapsulate the communication between other objects.

# Chain of Responsibility: 
	- Allows building a chain of objects to process a request.

# Visitor: 
	- Allows adding new operations to an object structure without modifying it.
